Roselia-Encore is a general encore site for virtual artists like bands or idols who has a voice actor.

We use Roselia, a band in BanG Dream! project as a demonstration. The prof-of-concept proves we can only change configuration files written in `TypeScript` to distinct artists since there are 7 bands in BanG Dream! project and it is hard to write html for all of them. Hence, Roselia-Encore is more than a template.

In principle, you only need to edit `src/encoreInfo/siteConfig.ts`. 
You can refer to current configurations or type definitions and comments in `src/rhodonite/protocols/encore.ts`.
